Hi there ðŸ‘‹! This app is dedicated to a simple CRUD implementation, in order to help me develop my skills as a developer. You can also see how I work and provide advice on how to program.

Getting started
Before you start working on this repository, you need to clone it to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/usuario/repo.git
cd repo
Dependencies
After cloning the repository, you need to install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
or

bash
Copy code
yarn
Without these dependencies, the app will not function correctly.

Running the app
To run the app, you need to make sure that the backend is running:

Check that the backend is running at http://localhost:3000.
Start the frontend:
bash
Copy code
yarn start
And that's it! Happy hacking ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’».
