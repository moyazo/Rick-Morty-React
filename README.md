# Rick-Morty-React

Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This App will be dedicated to a normal crud, in order to develop my skills.
Also, you see how i work and you can advise how to program.

### FIRST OF ALL
Before you can work on this repo, you must clone the repo at your local pc.

          $ git clone https://github.com/usuario/repo.git
          $ cd repo
          
## DEPENDENCIES
Afte you have cloned it, we have to install or dependencies, without them or app will crush.

          - With npm:
          
              $ npm i
              
          - With yarn
          
              $ yarn
              
## Finally
You can now run up the app. But you should check that de BackEnd is active.

                $ Check BackEnd in url....
                $ yarn start


 HAPPY HACKING ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’»
